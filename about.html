		<h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
		<p>The world today is living with photography
			that has grown and gained recognition more
			than any other art. The light of the darkness
			of battles and riots, and of the beautiful
			moments that we wish to keep in our hearts.
			There are many reasons for
			people to travel long
			distances. For some it will
			be a picnic, a change from
			busy life, for some it will be
			an adventurous journey, for
			some it will be a desire to
			learn new cultures,
			lifestyles and cuisines, for
			others it will be a longing
			to know nature, for some it
			will be pilgrimage and
			spirituality.

		<h1 class="title">TRAVEL AND PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
		<p>One word or one paragraph is not enough to define photography. The books that wrote it do not fully define it. First I will say an art form of it. Light painting with precision. This is the only way to freeze a memory over time. The magic of time frames that travel in subtle form.</p>

				<h3 class="sub_title">Frames......</h3>
				<p>When we freeze an image time, we are frames of time and space, be it beautiful landscape scenes or a steaming cup of tea sitting on a table. Everything comes alive in our heads. Those sparks of imagination can be mixed with the burning memories of the past, which create a stimulus of emotions in our brain. A beautiful carnival will bring our minds and our hearts inside.</p>

				<p>Today, more than just a professional photographer, everyone is a photographer. With the advent of digital cameras and mobile cameras, everyone is a photographer. Here's the point of a good photographer. The good quality of a good photographer is that he can see the views from many angles. View from an angle that no one can see. For that we must first observe well. Every moment we have a lot of frames in front of us when we see it and put it in the camera. Becoming a good photographer.</p>

				<p>Not having a good camera does not eliminate good pictures. When we have a good moment, the camera in our hand is the best camera. Today, there are many people who take beautiful pictures, even on mobile cameras. Not only this, with the advent of social media today our pictures will be able to reach the world quickly

					A good photographer should always be ready for every moment that comes before us at any moment </p>
